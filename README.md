### What is TDD?
Test-Driven Development is a technique for building software incrementally. simply put no production code is written before without first writing a failing unit test  _**Tests are small.**_ _**Tests are automated**_  Test-driving is logical instead of diving into the production code, leaving testing for later the Tdd practitioner expresses the desired behavior of the code in tests. only then do they write the code making tests pass.

just as with any skills. TDD skills take time to develop. Many devs have adopted would not go back to debug-later programming 

- `Fewer bugs`
- `Less debug time`
